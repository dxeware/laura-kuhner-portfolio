    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I'm an application software developer who loves the creative process. I have 12 years of experience as a developer but took 8 years off after when my children were young. I'm excited about web development and am currently learning Javascript. I'm hoping that the <i>Thinkful</i> course training will help me springboard back into my software development career.</p>
    <p>STEM education for young kids is extremely important to me. I'm very <strong>passionate</strong> about getting children eager to learn about science, technology, engineering, and math.</p>
